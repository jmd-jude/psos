# Quadrant-Specific Strategic Playbooks

## Framework Overview

The PSOS (Product Strategy & Opportunity Scoring) framework plots use cases on a 2x2 matrix:
- **X-Axis**: Opportunity Score (1-5) - Business value and market potential
- **Y-Axis**: Maturity Score (1-5) - Capability readiness and product quality

Quadrants are determined by 3.0 threshold on each axis:
- **INVEST**: High Opportunity (≥3.0), Low Maturity (<3.0)
- **HARVEST**: High Opportunity (≥3.0), High Maturity (≥3.0)
- **MAINTAIN**: Low Opportunity (<3.0), High Maturity (≥3.0)
- **DEPRIORITIZE**: Low Opportunity (<3.0), Low Maturity (<3.0)

## INVEST Quadrant (High Opportunity, Low Maturity)

### Strategic Intent
**"Build to Capture"**

These are high-value market opportunities where we currently lack the capability to compete effectively. They require significant R&D investment to build the necessary maturity to capture the opportunity.

### Characteristics
- Strong customer demand or market pull
- High revenue potential (typically >$500K ARR)
- Competitive threats if we don't act
- Current capability gaps prevent winning deals

### Resource Allocation
- **Heavy R&D investment**: 60-80% of resources go to capability building
- **Product/Engineering focus**: 6-12 month build-out timeline
- **Limited sales effort**: Only target early adopters willing to wait

### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Move to HARVEST quadrant within 12 months
- **Secondary**: 
  - Achieve maturity score ≥3.0 across all pillars
  - Win 2-3 reference customers
  - Reduce sales cycle by 30%

### Investment Decision Criteria
Invest if:
- Opportunity score ≥4.0 AND addressable market >$10M
- No alternative vendor can serve this need
- Technical feasibility validated (not science fiction)
- Executive sponsorship secured

Do NOT invest if:
- Opportunity score <3.5
- Build effort >18 months (market will move on)
- Alternative vendors already dominate
- Unclear path to maturity

### Risk Factors
- **Execution failure**: Underestimate build complexity, miss deadlines
- **Market timing miss**: Build takes too long, market shifts
- **Resource drain**: Starves HARVEST quadrant of optimization resources
- **Opportunity cost**: Could have invested in other INVEST use cases

### Typical Examples
- **Real-Time Identity Resolution** (requires infrastructure build-out)
- **Privacy-Preserving Clean Room** (requires new data architecture)
- **AI-Powered Lookalike Modeling** (requires ML platform)

### Playbook Actions

#### Months 1-3: Validate & Plan
- [ ] Conduct customer discovery (10+ interviews)
- [ ] Technical feasibility spike (2-week engineering investigation)
- [ ] Competitive analysis (what do others offer?)
- [ ] Build detailed product roadmap with milestones
- [ ] Secure executive buy-in and budget

#### Months 4-9: Build Core Capability

- [ ] Build MVP with 1-2 pilot customers
- [ ] Iterate based on pilot feedback
- [ ] Document product requirements and limitations

#### Months 10-12: Market Readiness
- [ ] Achieve Market Readiness maturity ≥3.0
- [ ] Complete sales enablement (collateral, demos, training)
- [ ] Win 2-3 reference customers
- [ ] Prepare case studies and pricing model
- [ ] Transition to HARVEST quadrant

#### Red Flags (Reevaluate if you see these)
- 🚩 6 months in, still at maturity <2.0
- 🚩 Scope creep (requirements keep changing)
- 🚩 Key technical lead leaves project
- 🚩 Market opportunity declining (opportunity score drops)
- 🚩 Competing vendor launches similar solution

## HARVEST Quadrant (High Opportunity, High Maturity)

### Strategic Intent
**"Maximize Returns"**

These are mature capabilities in high-value markets. The goal is to extract maximum revenue and profit while optimizing operational efficiency.

### Characteristics
- Proven product-market fit
- Strong win rates (>40%)
- Mature capabilities (maturity ≥3.0)
- Large addressable market

### Resource Allocation
- **Sales & Marketing focus**: 60% of resources go to customer acquisition
- **Operational optimization**: 30% on efficiency and margin improvement
- **Incremental innovation**: 10% on competitive differentiation

### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Revenue growth and gross margin expansion
- **Secondary**:
  - 30%+ gross margin
  - <90 day sales cycles
  - >50% win rate
  - Net revenue retention >110%

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Scale sales motion**: Hire specialized reps, build repeatable playbooks
2. **Improve margins**: Automate operations, renegotiate vendor costs, optimize infrastructure
3. **Expand to adjacencies**: New verticals, new use cases, international markets
4. **Competitive moat**: Build features competitors can't easily replicate (data scale, match rates, integration depth)

### Risk Factors
- **Commoditization**: Competitors catch up, price pressure increases
- **Market saturation**: TAM exhausted, growth slows
- **Complacency**: Team takes success for granted, quality slips
- **Over-optimization**: Cut too deep, customer experience suffers

### Typical Examples
- **Email-to-MAID Linkage** (mature capability, strong demand)
- **Household Resolution for CTV** (proven ROI, established market)
- **Offline-to-Online Attribution** (standard offering, competitive)

### Playbook Actions

#### Quarterly: Growth Acceleration
- [ ] Review pipeline coverage (3x target required)
- [ ] Optimize pricing (test 10-15% price increases)
- [ ] Expand sales team (1-2 new reps per quarter)
- [ ] Launch competitive campaigns (win competitive deals)
- [ ] Develop case studies (prove ROI to new prospects)

#### Quarterly: Margin Improvement
- [ ] Review gross margin by customer (target 35%+)
- [ ] Identify cost reduction opportunities (infrastructure, vendor costs)
- [ ] Automate manual processes (reduce operational overhead)
- [ ] Optimize product packaging (upsell, cross-sell)

#### Annually: Strategic Expansion
- [ ] Identify new vertical expansion (2-3 new verticals/year)
- [ ] Build international expansion plan (if applicable)
- [ ] Evaluate acquisition targets (buy vs. build)
- [ ] Develop platform partnerships (expand distribution)

#### Red Flags (Shift resources if you see these)
- 🚩 Revenue growth <20% YoY
- 🚩 Win rate declining (below 40%)
- 🚩 Gross margin <25%
- 🚩 New competitor taking market share
- 🚩 Customer churn increasing

## MAINTAIN Quadrant (Low Opportunity, High Maturity)

### Strategic Intent
**"Efficient Sustain"**

These are mature capabilities in low-value markets. The goal is to maintain them with minimal resources while avoiding quality degradation.

### Characteristics
- Mature product (maturity ≥3.0)
- Limited market opportunity (opportunity <3.0)
- Potentially legacy or niche use cases
- Small but loyal customer base

### Resource Allocation
- **Minimal engineering**: <10% of resources on maintenance
- **Operational efficiency**: Automate everything possible
- **Selective sales**: Only pursue high-value deals (no small deals)

### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Maintain gross margin >40%, minimize resource allocation
- **Secondary**:
  - Zero unplanned downtime
  - <5% customer churn
  - Positive cash flow
  - <10% engineering time allocation

### Maintenance Strategies
1. **Automation**: Eliminate manual operations, self-service where possible
2. **Standardization**: Reduce customization, enforce standard SKUs
3. **Price optimization**: Raise prices 10-15% annually (value-based, not cost-plus)
4. **Consolidation**: Combine with related offerings to reduce overhead

### Divestiture Evaluation
Consider selling or sunsetting if:
- ARR <$500K and declining
- Gross margin <30%
- Technical debt accumulating (expensive to maintain)
- Requires dedicated resources that could be redeployed
- Strategic misfit (doesn't align with core business)

### Risk Factors
- **Technical debt**: Neglecting maintenance leads to outages, customer churn
- **"Zombie" status**: Use case limps along, consuming resources without value
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: Keeping it because we already built it, not because it makes sense

### Typical Examples
- **Legacy API integrations** (old platforms, small customer base)
- **Niche vertical offerings** (high maturity but tiny TAM)
- **Deprecated data sources** (still functional but declining relevance)

### Playbook Actions

#### Quarterly: Efficiency Review
- [ ] Review resource allocation (<10% target)
- [ ] Identify automation opportunities
- [ ] Assess technical debt accumulation
- [ ] Evaluate customer health (churn risk)
- [ ] Consider price increases (10-15% annually)

#### Annually: Strategic Review
- [ ] Evaluate divestiture options (sell, sunset, consolidate)
- [ ] Assess opportunity score (has market changed?)
- [ ] Review competitor activity (are they exiting too?)
- [ ] Calculate cost of maintenance vs. revenue

#### Red Flags (Consider divestiture if you see these)
- 🚩 Engineering time >10% of capacity
- 🚩 Frequent production incidents
- 🚩 Customer churn >10% annually
- 🚩 Revenue <$250K ARR
- 🚩 Negative contribution margin

## DEPRIORITIZE Quadrant (Low Opportunity, Low Maturity)

### Strategic Intent
**"Sunset or Redirect"**

These are immature capabilities in low-value markets. The default action is to sunset them within 6-12 months and redirect resources to INVEST or HARVEST quadrants.

### Characteristics
- Low maturity (maturity <3.0)
- Low market opportunity (opportunity <3.0)
- Likely experimental or pilot use cases
- Minimal customer traction

### Resource Allocation
- **Minimal or zero**: No new investment
- **Sunset planning**: 6-12 month wind-down timeline
- **Customer migration**: Move to alternative solutions

### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Successful retirement with <5% customer impact
- **Secondary**:
  - Zero new sales
  - Redirect resources to higher-value quadrants
  - Complete sunset within 12 months
  - Minimal technical debt left behind

### When to Keep (Exceptions)
Consider retaining if:
- **Strategic dependency**: Required for HARVEST use case
- **Contractual obligation**: Committed to customer for X years
- **Low maintenance cost**: <$100K annually, minimal engineering time
- **Potential opportunity shift**: Market expected to grow (re-score quarterly)

### Sunset Process
1. **Communicate early**: Give customers 6-12 months notice
2. **Provide alternatives**: Recommend competitor or alternative approach
3. **Offer migration support**: Help customers transition smoothly
4. **Decommission infrastructure**: Avoid "zombie" services consuming resources
5. **Document learnings**: What did we learn? What would we do differently?

### Risk Factors
- **Customer backlash**: Poor communication leads to churn and reputation damage
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: "We've invested so much, we can't stop now"
- **Zombie state**: Service lingers in maintenance mode indefinitely
- **Technical debt**: Decommissioning is harder than expected

### Typical Examples
- **Failed experiments** (low adoption, poor product-market fit)
- **Niche features** (only 1-2 customers use it)
- **Obsolete integrations** (platform no longer exists or relevant)

### Playbook Actions

#### Month 1: Decision & Communication
- [ ] Executive approval to sunset
- [ ] Draft customer communication plan
- [ ] Identify migration alternatives
- [ ] Calculate decommissioning cost

#### Months 2-6: Customer Migration
- [ ] Notify customers (6-month notice)
- [ ] Offer migration support
- [ ] Provide credits or discounts if needed
- [ ] Monitor customer satisfaction

#### Months 7-12: Decommission
- [ ] Turn off new customer access
- [ ] Sunset infrastructure
- [ ] Archive documentation
- [ ] Conduct post-mortem (lessons learned)

#### Red Flags (Abort sunset if you see these)
- 🚩 Major customer escalation (risk of churn)
- 🚩 Opportunity score increases to ≥3.0 (market changed)
- 🚩 Competitor acquires similar capability (signals market opportunity)
- 🚩 Strategic dependency identified (needed for HARVEST use case)

## Quadrant Transitions

### Goal: Move use cases up and to the right

**DEPRIORITIZE → MAINTAIN**
- Rare. Typically means maturing a capability in a low-opportunity market (not recommended).

**DEPRIORITIZE → INVEST**
- Happens when market opportunity increases. Re-evaluate quarterly.

**INVEST → HARVEST**
- **Target timeline**: 6-12 months
- **Key actions**: Build maturity, win reference customers, scale go-to-market

**INVEST → DEPRIORITIZE**
- Failure to build maturity or opportunity evaporates. Cut losses, redirect resources.

**MAINTAIN → HARVEST**
- Happens when market opportunity increases. Shift resources from sustain to growth.

**MAINTAIN → DEPRIORITIZE**
- Happens when opportunity declines further or costs become untenable. Plan sunset.

**HARVEST → MAINTAIN**
- Happens when market saturates or competition intensifies. Shift to efficiency mode.

**HARVEST → INVEST**
- Rare. Typically means losing maturity (quality regression) despite high opportunity. Address urgently.

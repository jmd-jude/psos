## Persona-Specific Objections & Responses

### "Your data is too expensive"
**Persona**: VP Marketing, E-commerce

**Response**: 
"Let's look at ROI. If you're spending $1M/year on paid media and we improve your match rate by 10%, that's $100K in incremental reach. Our $150K annual fee pays for itself in the first quarter. Plus, we have performance-based pricing options."

---

### "How do I know your data is accurate?"
**Persona**: Head of Analytics, CDO

**Response**: 
"Great question. We validate every linkage deterministically—no probabilistic modeling. Our email-to-MAID match rate is 65%, which is 10% above industry standard. We can provide a data sample for you to validate against your own ground truth, or run a proof-of-concept where you measure accuracy in your environment."

---

### "We already have a data provider"
**Persona**: VP Marketing, CMO

**Response**: 
"That's common. Most of our customers use multiple data sources. The question is: are you getting the match rates and coverage you need? We find that customers who blend our data with their existing provider see 15-20% incremental reach. Would you be open to a side-by-side test?"

---

### "What about privacy compliance?"
**Persona**: Legal, CDO

**Response**: 
"Privacy is built into our architecture from day one, not bolted on. We're CCPA and GDPR compliant, with audit trails, data lineage, and right-to-delete infrastructure. We can provide our SOC 2 report, DPA template, and privacy impact assessment. We also have a dedicated privacy counsel who can work with your legal team."

---

### "We don't have engineering resources to integrate"
**Persona**: VP Marketing

**Response**: 
"We offer three options: (1) RESTful APIs with comprehensive documentation for your team, (2) managed services where we handle the technical integration, or (3) pre-built connectors for platforms like Salesforce, Google Ads, and The Trade Desk. Most customers are up and running in 2-4 weeks with minimal engineering effort."

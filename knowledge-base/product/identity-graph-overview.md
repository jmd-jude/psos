# Identity Graph Product Overview

## What We've Built

We curate a proprietary data asset comprised of 70+ source feeds representing **1.6 trillion consumer events per month**. This provides full coverage of the U.S. adult population across every available consumer touchpoint, both offline-to-online and online-to-offline, in a fully compliant manner.

## Core Data Assets

Our identity graph includes:

### 1. PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
- Validated name and address associations at individual and household levels
- Deterministic linkage with accuracy validation at every link
- Full household resolution capabilities

### 2. Email
- Raw email addresses
- Hashed email (SHA256) for privacy-safe matching
- Email-to-household linkage

### 3. Phone Numbers
- Distinct mobile phone numbers
- Distinct landline phone numbers
- Phone-to-household and phone-to-individual linkage

### 4. Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs)
- Device identifiers paired with hashed email
- Cross-device linkage capabilities
- Persistent device tracking

### 5. IP Addresses
- Static and dynamic IP resolution
- IP-to-household mapping
- Geolocation capabilities

### 6. CTV-IFA (Connected TV Identifiers)
- Smart TV and streaming device identifiers
- Household-level TV viewership linkage

### 7. Consumer Attributes
- **496 total attributes** organized into **15 categories**
- Demographics, psychographics, behavioral signals
- Purchase intent and life event triggers

### 8. Digital Behaviors
- Website visits and browsing patterns
- App usage and engagement metrics
- Cross-channel behavioral signals

### 9. Financial Data
- Comprehensive financial attribution
- Discretionary income modeling
- Financial power metrics and credit indicators

### 10. Property Data
- Complete parcel and property details
- Transaction history
- Home value and equity estimates

### 11. Automotive Data
- VIN-level records
- Make, model, year details
- Purchase timing and ownership patterns

## Consumption Methods

We offer **four flexible methods** of data consumption to fit any client operating model:

### 1. Onsight
Installation into client data environment. Client maintains full control of data within their infrastructure.

**Best for:** Enterprises with existing data warehouses, strict data governance requirements

### 2. Realink
Automated API access against our clean room Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) platform. Real-time and batch query capabilities.

**Best for:** SaaS platforms, marketing clouds, real-time personalization use cases

### 3. Identity Authority
Native application access within cloud platforms or clean rooms. Client data remains at rest in their own data safe harbor while accessing our identity graph.

**Best for:** Privacy-first use cases, collaborative analytics, data partnership scenarios

### 4. Audiences
Custom and semi-custom syndicated audiences available in programmatic marketplaces and DSPs.

**Best for:** Media activation, programmatic advertising, quick-to-market campaigns

## Core Differentiators

### Deterministic Linkage
Every data linkage is deterministic (not probabilistic) and validated for accuracy across every link. This eliminates false positives and provides confidence in downstream decisioning.

### Full Scale
Complete coverage of U.S. adult population across all major identifier types. No sampling, no extrapolation.

### Compliance-by-Design
CCPA, GDPR, and global privacy framework compliance built into data architecture from day one. Not a bolt-on solution.

### Flexibility
Four consumption models support diverse client needs from real-time APIs to batch enrichment to marketplace activation.

## Primary Use Cases Supported

1. **Identity Resolution**: Match disparate identifiers to unified consumer profiles
2. **Data Enrichment**: Append attributes to first-party data
3. **Profile Intelligence**: Build comprehensive consumer understanding
4. **Audience Activation**: Target specific segments across channels
5. **Measurement & Attribution**: Connect exposure to outcomes across touchpoints

## Market Structure

The identity resolution and data enrichment market is fragmented across several categories:

### Identity Graph Specialists
Pure-play identity resolution providers focused on deterministic or probabilistic linkage.

### Customer Data Platforms (CDPs)
Marketing technology platforms with identity resolution as a feature, not core competency.

### Data Brokers & Aggregators
Traditional data providers pivoting to identity solutions.

### Clean Room / Privacy-First Platforms
Emerging category focused on privacy-preserving collaboration.
